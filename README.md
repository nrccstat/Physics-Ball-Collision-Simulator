# Ball Collision Simulation

A visually interactive 2D ball collision simulator built with Python and Pygame. Adjust ball properties, add/remove balls, and observe realistic physics with gravity, friction, and bounciness. Now with NumPy integration for efficient calculations and statistics!

## Features
- Add balls with custom radius, velocity, color, and bounciness
- Realistic gravity, friction, and elastic collisions
- Modern UI with sliders and color selectors
- Statistics: number of balls and average speed
- Uses NumPy for efficient array operations

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- pygame
- numpy

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame numpy
   ```

## Usage
Run the simulation with:
```bash
python ballsim.py
```

## Controls
- Use sliders to set radius, velocity, and bounciness
- Click a color to select ball color
- Click "Add Ball" to add a new ball
- Click a ball to remove it

## Customization
- Adjust gravity, friction, or UI layout in `ballsim.py`
- Extend with more statistics or features using NumPy
